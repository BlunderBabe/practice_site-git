   <p>She lives life for the stories : Thirty-one years ago, in tiny town on the border of Canada, in upstate New York, a super-hero was born...</p>

   <p>Its 9pm Thursday night when the brilliant idea to head out of Bangkok for the weekend strikes. My pasty flesh craves a smog-free sun kiss. The din of the city resonates through my veins, into my brain; its waves wash up images of sand and sea.
  Its respite I need; and I need it Now. </p>
 
  <p> Without hesitation, I rummage about the ruins of clothing and ‘stuff’ I call my apartment. My rucksack is packed in five minutes—leaving me with plenty of time to catch the 10:50pm train to Champorn, a port town with ferry service to Koh Tao—a southern Thailand Island Paradise, or so I’ve heard. </p>
 
   <p>I’m out the door as soon as I send the week’s final work related email. </p>

   <p>A taxi is ready and waiting outside my apartment building on Suan Plu. My ATM card, stolen a week earlier arrived today. I have credit on my phone and plenty of cash in my wallet.</p>
 
   <p>There is only one person in the ticket booth queue.
 
   Everything goes smoothly, which when you’re me, should arouse suspicions immediately.
 
   But right now, I am certain that nothing can bring me down.
 
   “One way second class ticket to Champorn,” I say.
 
   “Sold out,” with two words the cashier has successfully quashed my high. I’m only relieved that I didn’t put any wagers on ‘certainty.’
 
   For I while, I wallow in denial. I scour the passenger crowd, hoping to find someone willing to sell me their ticket…for double the price. At rock-bottom desperation—I’m ready to offer 2000 baht, and my backpack—my senses bounce back.  I finally admit defeat, and leave the train station. </p>
